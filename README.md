## Introduction

This guide helps you set up a vulnerability management lab where you will install Nessus Essentials, VMware Workstation Player, and a Windows 10 VM. You will conduct vulnerability scans, identify vulnerabilities, and remediate them to learn practical skills in vulnerability management.

## Prerequisites

- A computer with at least 8GB of RAM and a dual-core processor
- Internet connection
- Basic knowledge of IT and cybersecurity

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install VMware Workstation Player

1. Download VMware Workstation Player from the [VMware website](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### 2. Download Windows 10 ISO

1. Go to the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and download the Windows 10 installation media tool.
2. Run the tool and select "Create installation media."
3. Choose "ISO file" and save it to a location you can remember.

### 3. Download and Install Nessus Essentials

1. Go to the [Tenable website](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials) and register for a Nessus Essentials account.
2. Download the Nessus installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.
3. Save the activation code sent to your email for later use.

### 4. Set Up Windows 10 Virtual Machine

1. Open VMware Workstation Player and click "Create a New Virtual Machine."
2. Select "Installer disc image file (iso)" and browse to the Windows 10 ISO you downloaded.
3. Follow the prompts to set up the virtual machine, allocating at least 50GB of disk space.
4. Customize the hardware settings, ensuring the network adapter is set to "Bridged."
5. Complete the Windows 10 installation inside the VM.

### 5. Ensure Connectivity with VM

1. Inside the VM, open Command Prompt and run `ipconfig` to find the VM's IP address.
2. On your host machine, open Command Prompt and run `ping <VM_IP_address>` to ensure connectivity.
3. If the ping fails, disable the Windows Firewall on the VM:
    ```bash
    wf.msc
    ```
    - Turn off the firewall for all profiles (Domain, Private, Public).

### 6. Create and Run Nessus Scan

1. Open Nessus Essentials in your web browser and log in.
2. Click "New Scan" and select "Basic Network Scan."
3. Enter a name for the scan and the VM's IP address as the target.
4. Save and launch the scan.
5. Review the scan results to identify vulnerabilities.

### 7. Configure VM for Credentialed Scans

1. Inside the VM, enable the Remote Registry service:
    ```bash
    services.msc
    ```
    - Set the Remote Registry service to "Automatic" and start it.
2. Enable File and Printer Sharing:
    - Go to Network and Sharing Center -> Change advanced sharing settings.
    - Turn on network discovery and file and printer sharing.
3. Disable User Account Control (UAC):
    ```bash
    UserAccountControlSettings.exe
    ```
    - Set the slider to "Never notify."
4. Add a registry key to allow remote access:
    ```bash
    regedit
    ```
    - Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`.
    - Add a new DWORD `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` and set its value to `1`.
5. Restart the VM.

### 8. Perform Credentialed Scan

1. Edit the previously created Nessus scan and add Windows credentials.
    - Enter the VM's username (e.g., `admin`) and password.
2. Save and launch the scan again.
3. Review the new scan results, which should show more detailed vulnerabilities.

### 9. Install Deprecated Software and Rescan

1. Download an old version of Firefox (e.g., Firefox 36.0.12) inside the VM.
2. Install the deprecated software.
3. Run the Nessus scan again.
4. Review the scan results to identify vulnerabilities introduced by the old software.

### 10. Remediate Vulnerabilities

1. Uninstall the deprecated software:
    ```bash
    appwiz.cpl
    ```
    - Uninstall Firefox or other outdated applications.
2. Run Windows Update and install all available updates.
3. Perform a final Nessus scan to verify that the vulnerabilities have been remediated.

## Skills and Technologies Learned

- **Virtualization and VM Management**: Learned to set up and manage virtual machines using VMware Workstation Player, including configuring network settings and installing operating systems.
- **Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis**: Gained experience in using Nessus Essentials to conduct vulnerability scans, interpret scan results, and identify security weaknesses in systems.
- **Vulnerability Remediation**: Developed skills in remediating identified vulnerabilities by applying system updates, uninstalling deprecated software, and configuring systems for secure operation.
